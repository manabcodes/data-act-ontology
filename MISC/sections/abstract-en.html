<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The EU Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854) establishes a comprehensive framework for data access and sharing across the European data economy, yet its complexity hinders automated compliance and technical implementation. This paper presents the EU Data Act Ontology, a formal, machine-readable representation of the regulation designed to enable automated reasoning, compliance checking, and semantic interoperability. The ontology formalizes rights and obligations of users, data holders, and data recipients using deontic logic, models B2C, B2B, and B2G data-sharing scenarios, and traces all concepts to specific articles of the Data Act. Developed following the NeOn Methodology and competency question-driven design, the ontology contains 80 classes and 80+ properties organized into modules representing actors, legal rules, FRAND conditions, and data types. Applications include automated contract validation, decision support systems, regulatory oversight tools, and semantic infrastructure for European data spaces, providing a foundational layer for machine-readable data governance aligned with EU regulatory principles.</span>
