<span class="markdown">The European Union's Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854) represents a landmark legislative framework governing data access, sharing, and use across the European data economy. By establishing clear rights and obligations for users, data holders, and data recipients, the Data Act aims to unlock the value of industrial and IoT-generated data while ensuring fair, secure, and competitive data markets. However, the complexity and novelty of the Data Act pose significant challenges for legal interpretation, technical implementation, and compliance verification. Traditional legal texts, while authoritative, lack the formal structure required for automated reasoning, machine-readable compliance checking, and seamless integration with digital systems. This gap between regulatory intent and technical operationalization hinders the practical enforcement of data rights, the development of compliant data-sharing platforms, and the scalability of European data spaces.

The EU Data Act Ontology addresses this challenge by providing a formal, machine-readable representation of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. Specifically, the ontology formalizes the rights, obligations, permissions, and prohibitions of actors in the data ecosystem (users, data holders, data recipients, public bodies); represents legal rules using deontic logic, enabling computational reasoning over obligations and exceptions; models data sharing scenarios across Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), and Business-to-Government (B2G) contexts; traces ontology concepts to specific articles of the Data Act, ensuring transparency and auditability; and supports automated compliance checking, contract validation, and decision support for data governance. The ontology primarily covers Chapters II, III, and V of the Data Act, focusing on user access rights, B2B data sharing under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) conditions, and public sector data access in exceptional circumstances. Additional elements from Chapters VI and VII related to interoperability, switching, and smart contracts are also represented.

This ontology is designed to serve regulatory authorities seeking to monitor compliance and audit implementations; data holders (manufacturers, service providers, platforms) requiring tools to manage access requests and implement FRAND terms; users and data recipients needing clear representations of their rights and obligations; software developers building data spaces, smart contracts, and compliance tools requiring semantic interoperability; and researchers and academics studying digital regulation, legal informatics, and AI governance frameworks. Key applications include automated compliance checking through SPARQL queries and reasoning engines, automatic generation of FRAND-compliant data access contracts, decision support systems for navigating legal obligations, regulatory oversight tools for identifying violations and unfair terms, educational platforms providing structured representations of Data Act provisions, semantic infrastructure for European data spaces (e.g., Gaia-X, IDSA), trade secret protection workflows, and interoperability standards for data porting and multi-cloud environments.

The ontology development followed the NeOn Methodology for ontology engineering and reuse, employed Competency Question-driven design to ensure stakeholder needs are met (10 core CQs formulated), established legal source traceability linking every class and property to specific articles of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854, applied deontic logic formalization using concepts from normative systems, reused existing vocabularies where applicable (e.g., GDPR ontologies, DPV, ODRL), and conducted iterative validation through SPARQL query testing and reasoning consistency checks. The ontology contains 80 classes, 60+ object properties, and 20+ data properties, organized into modules representing actors, legal rules, data types, FRAND conditions, and data-sharing scenarios.</span>
